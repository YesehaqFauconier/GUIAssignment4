His current address is an arbitrary cell in some block of Riker’s Island New York; It is a place society resents and neglects, because it is a place that index’s all of its flaws. Therefore society keeps it out of mind until it needs something to hate. Thus Jamal Walker observes society from time to time as it observes him.

He gets off his bed goes to the and brushes his teeth.  ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
